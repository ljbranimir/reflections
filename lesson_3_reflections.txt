Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

A: In case I'm in collaboration with other people on the same project/repository.
Also, if the project is important it's good to have a backup which is remote.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because we want to have a full control over the current work/development, and
one wouldn't want that project files change and potentially causes some conflicts
in the middle of important work. So full control and manual pull is a better
solution IMHO.
