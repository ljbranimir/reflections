Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When one initializes a repository an empty repository is created with the
initial version of the repository and its history. There's no files added yet,
just the necessary hidden .git folder. This is the first, initial step that is
necessary in order to create a repository that can later be version controled,
downloaded from a remote machine, etc.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: It is like a bridge between working directory and repository. Like the relevant
files are in some middle zone.Files have to be added firstly in order that the same
ones are afterwards commited. Have to admit that I'm not sure for the value,
after the files are added thay are under the version control, but the files are
just prepared with these method to be commited.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

A: The stanging area helps here because it enables us to prepare exactly what we
want to commit, while in the same time changes that are not belonging to the
relevant logical change stay in the working directory.
