Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When one initializes a repository an empty repository is created with the
initial version of the repository and its history. There's no files added yet,
just the necessary hidden .git folder. This is the first, initial step that is
necessary in order to create a repository that can later be version controled,
downloaded from a remote machine, etc.
